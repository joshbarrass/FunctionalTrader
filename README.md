## Why the name?

FunctionalTrader gets its name because it's written in Haskell, a functional programming language. It's also ironic, because this software is far less functional than well-established alternatives like [MGU](https://github.com/smrealms/mgu) or [TheLazyTrader](https://github.com/smrealms/TheLazyTrader).
